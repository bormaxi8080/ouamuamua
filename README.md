![alt text](./img/ouamuamua.png)

Oumuamua is the first interstellar object detected passing through the Solar System.[21] Formally designated 1I/2017 U1, it was discovered by Robert Weryk using the Pan-STARRS telescope at HaleakalƒÅ Observatory, Hawaii, on 19 October 2017, approximately 40 days after it passed its closest point to the Sun on 9 September. When it was first observed, it was about 33 million km (21 million mi; 0.22 AU) from Earth (about 85 times as far away as the Moon) and already heading away from the Sun.
